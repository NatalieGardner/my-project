# My Digital Literacy Narrative

Over the course of the semester, I have expanded my digital literacy in WRIT 4662W Writing with Digital Technologies. This site will serve to provide a narrative of my digital literacy development.

Much like Kyle D. Stedman stated in the article *What are New Literacies*, before this course I thought of digital literacy in terms of something I am lacking and something that I need to improve. I did not often take the time to reflect on where I started and what I have accomplished. This course has taught me to think about digital literacy in terms of discovering new knowledge. Instead of thinking about all the things I do not know with a negative mindset, now I think about the exciting possibilities of engaging with new technologies. 

My digital literacy journey has been influenced by peers, friends, family, instructors, and mentors. It has been sculpted by educational computer games and online tutorials. I have read books and watched films that illustrate and analyze the history of computers and the internet which has given me a broader perspective on computer science. I have taken courses that taught me how to code in HTML and use Adobe Creative Suite. While I am not a coding guru, I am always learning. Developing my digital literacy to this point has given me the foundation necessary to continue learning in WRIT 4662W. I have learned a lot in this course and will continue learning how to better write for digital spaces and create interactive content that is informative and engaging.
